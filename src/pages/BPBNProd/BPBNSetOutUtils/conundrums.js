//      THE ALMOND CROISSANT SET OUT CONUNDRUM
//
//      Almond croissants make use of day old croissants.  So we
//      need to set out plain croissants one day ahead of time in
//      order to be able to make them.  So there is no such thing
//      as setting out an almond croissant even though, by default,
//      it is considered to be a 'Croissant' dough.
//
//      Also need to account for the fact that an almond croissant
//      that is delivered from Carlton needs to be brought up frozen
//      the day before.  So if delivery is on Fri, it needs to be 
//      brought up on Thurs, made on Wed, so set out as Plain on Tues
//      at Prado.
